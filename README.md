## 🤝 Support

### ❓ Common Questions

**Q: I have zero Python experience. Can I still use this?**
A: Yes! Start with the tutorial notebook - everything is explained step-by-step.

**Q: My forecasts seem unrealistic. What should I check?**
A: Check data quality, model accuracy metrics (MAPE), and compare with business intuition.

**Q: Can I add my own features (covariates)?**  
A: Absolutely! See the `add_github_product_covariates()` function for examples.

**Q: How accurate are these forecasts?**
A: Depends on data quality and market stability. Typical accuracy is 10-30% MAPE for business data.

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Error: "No module named 'darts'"**
```bash
pip install darts
```

**Error: "Insufficient data"**
- Need at least 24 months of data per country
- Check for missing values in critical columns

**Poor model performance:**
- Try different ensemble weights
- Add more covariates  
- Use longer training periods
